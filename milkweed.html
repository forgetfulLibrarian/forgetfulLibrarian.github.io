<h1>Milkweed</h1>
<p>Poems about autism</p>

  <h2>Literally</h2>
    <p>When we played in the rain <br>
and you took mud piles and called them a castle.<br>
I understood.<br>
And that was ok.<br>
When you took mud and called it cake,<br>
I hesitated<br>
but agreed.<br>
But then you took a bite<br>
and offered some to me.<br>
And I refused<br>
to eat the slimy grit and crunchy bugs<br>
and my pride<br>
and my understanding of the rules of reality.<br>
And you stretched the mud between your fingers<br>
and complained<br>
“You always take things literally.”<br></p>

  <h2>Theif</h2>
  <p>I’ve never been embarrassed<br>
of being naked<br>
because I learned not to judge<br>
a body<br>
or the person in it.<br>
But for some reason<br>
in polite company,<br>
they wear fancy clothes<br>
and use fancy words<br>
but while they refuse to break eye contact,<br>
all I can see is that<br>
no one is wearing pants.<br>
They must know that <br>
I’ve noticed<br>
but act surprised<br>
as if I stole a secret<br>
and made them naked.<br></p>
