<h1>Forgetful Librarian</h1>

<p>Love My party people</p>
  <p>Jimmy at the door
askin
“Can I come in?”
“Can I come in Sue can I come in?”
Not yet Jimmy 
cuz I know where ya been.
I love you
but I know your sins.

Jimmy at the door
askin
“Why not now?”
“Why not now Sue Why not now?”
You could be forgiven
but I don’t know how.
I love you
but I will not bow.

Jimmy at the door
saying
“You’re no fun.
“You’re no fun Sue You’re no fun”
You could come in
if you didn’t have a gun.
I love you
but I think we’re done.
