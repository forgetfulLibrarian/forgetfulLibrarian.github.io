<h1>Forgetful Librarian</h1>
<p>What<br><br>
What can I tell you?<br>
But to assure you<br>
That the anger is there.<br>
But it’s not always expressed.<br>
<br>
That if I’m still here,<br>
I’m committing to working on that anger.<br>
I can see you struggle<br>
Like it’s ending.<br>
But it’s not ending.<br>
It has not ended.<br>
Until you end it.<br>
<br>
So don’t threaten me with apathy.<br>
When I care enough<br>
To be<br>
angry.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Face Paint<br><br>
You keep painting someone else’s name on my face.<br>
Like you don’t even see me.<br>
You just see someone you loved.<br>
<br>
-Of course I do.<br>
-And I love you too.<br>
-And you remind me of them.<br>
-Even if I compare you to others<br>
-Because I’m trying to understand you.<br>
-For me, understanding is part of love.<br>
-And I am trying so so hard to understand.<br>
-I don’t judge you poorly.<br>
-I don’t rank loved ones.<br>
-I want you to know how I came to my conclusion.<br>
-Because I could be wrong.<br>
-It’s more that I understand things because<br>
-I’ve seen similarities before in other people.<br>
-But no, I see you.<br>
-I promise I’m listening to you.<br>
-Even if I’m bad at listening.<br>
-I see you.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>What<br><br>
Mouthful<br>
Of Marbles<br>
For teeth<br>
Which you can’t use<br>
To chew<br>
All the pasture<br>
<br>
Marked by headstones.<br>
<br>
And you call me - liar<br>
A lecturer<br>
 -A lunatic.<br>
But you kept on calling<br>
Now you can’t reach my phone.<br>
<br>
You paint me your siren.<br>
And sail down to the bottom.<br>
Overdose on the salts<br>
Under sea<br>
and your foam.<br>
<br>
Why would I offer support<br>
When I came to drown you?<br>
To detonate the bomb<br>
Before you hurt those I love?<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Future<br><br>
The future is imaginary<br>
And I don’t live there.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Dandelion<br>
I think about dandelions a lot.  <br>
How they are reincarnated over and over.<br>
The perfect symbol of resilience and adaptation <br>
and speed in an environment shaped by adults <br>
who want to kill anything different.  <br>

<br>The thing that Shouldn’t Be.  
<br>The thing that is Literally spread by the wishes of
<br>Children against the authority of adults. <br>
A thing each child grows up to either kill themselves,<br>
hire or teach others to kill, or else be too tired to fight<br>
and let go as the flowers bloom.<br>
	Rarely do adults advocate for the dandelion. <br>
  For simpler wishes.  <br>
  For a world different than one where so so many <br>
  systems of violence crash down and <br>
  smash every other plant but the <br>
  Singular and Solitary Military Haircut Grass.<br>
  Because this is MY lawn and MY land and <br>
  I’ll be damned if the neighbors <br>
  think they can talk shit about me and mine.<br>
	When I think about my twenties, <br>
  I think of the ways my own wishes<br>
  propelled me to grow, transform, and <br>
  fly off at the end of a season only to land in the cracks<br>
  between rocks or among more established fauna.<br>
  When Nothing was permitted to grow there, <br>
  I found myself growing there anyway.  <br>
  And when it was finally time for someone to get the weedkiller,<br>
  I sent myself off.<br>
	Looking for an abandoned lawn to conquer.<br>
	Looking to spread.<br>
	And be the first stage<br>
	Of the ecosystem shift<br>
	Returning biodiversity<br>
	To my community.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
I actually like it here a lot<br>
<br>
In the winter,<br>
I hide under make up<br>
And jerk my legs to swirl the costume<br>
and belt my lines to the cheap seats<br>
And I spin my hands<br>
To stir a reaction in the crowd<br>
To Dazzle<br>
Racing the hot lights until I melt all the way<br>
Then break to refreeze in the snow alley<br>
Next to the concession’s trash<br>
Paper cups and food scraps<br>
are receipts for gold and public admiration.<br>
No I don’t smoke<br>
So the cigarettes don’t cover the smell.<br>
But I can pretend.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Again<br>
Every time you search my name.<br>
Find my profile on work websites.<br>
Look up public records with my information.<br>
Search house purchase records for nearby cities.<br>
Ask for a friend of a friend<br>
To talk to me.<br>
Do they even know me?<br>
Drive past our old apartment<br>
Or the other one<br>
Or the other one.<br>
Call my old workplaces and ask for my shift times.<br>
Draw my face on top of porn.<br>
Name things in your studio apartment after me and yell at them as they throw themselves to the ground and break.<br>
Print candid photos you stole without permission.<br>
Tape them around the room<br>
And to the blow up doll that doesn’t bruise.<br>
Scratch my name into your arm with the back of a pen.<br>
Buy me a cake on my birthday and eat it alone.<br>
Use my social security number as your locker combination.<br>
Tell the barista my name is yours<br>
Just so you can pretend for a moment<br>
You might run into me at the counter.<br>
In case my hair changed<br>
And you didn’t recognize me in the crowd.<br>
Or order food hoping the delivery driver is me.<br>
Or look over the copies of my homework you stole.<br>
Picking out mistakes<br>
And writing a correction report only to cry when you have <br>
no where to send it?<br>
<br>
I hate you.<br>
You will never get anything more from me.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Made for you<br><br>
Crumbs.<br>
Cold water<br>
Rest.<br>
Scream.<br>
Didn’t pay the sandman this month.<br>
Evicted from my dreams.<br>
<br>
Sit to do the dishes.<br>
Put pillows on the floor.<br>
A pile of dirt I call my friend<br>
Who could ask for more?<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Bread<br><br>
Anger like a low grade fever<br>
Sweatin’.  Got the chills.<br>
Ignore alarms for medications.<br>
I don’t trust the pills.<br>
<br>
What if I can just get better?<br>
Isn’t that insane?<br>
Rise like bread a slow tradition.<br>
Only bake my brain.<br>
<br>
I love me.<br>
After what you did why wouldn’t I be angry?<br>
<br>
</p>
